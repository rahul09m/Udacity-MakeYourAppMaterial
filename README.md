Project 5 of the Udacity Android Nanodegree course. In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

###Why this Project?
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

###Getting Started
This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the "gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

###User Feedback for Stock Hawk:
* "This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd."
- "Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."
- "The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad."

##Rubric

####Required Behavior
- App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).
- App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.
- App theme extends from AppCompat.
- App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.
- App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).
- App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.
